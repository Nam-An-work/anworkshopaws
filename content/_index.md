# Optimizing Data Pipelines for Real-time Analysis and Transformation on AWS
### Overall
The workshop will provide a comprehensive overview of building an analytics platform on AWS, covering each stage of the data processing pipeline. It will explore how to efficiently ingest, store, transform, and analyze data by utilizing a range of powerful AWS services. Key services such as AWS Glue for data preparation, Amazon Athena for querying data, Amazon Kinesis for real-time data streaming, Amazon EMR for big data processing, and Amazon QuickSight for data visualization will be discussed. Additionally, AWS Lambda and Amazon Redshift will be introduced for serverless computing and data warehousing, respectively, offering scalable solutions for building robust analytics systems.
