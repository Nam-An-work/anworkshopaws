To begin, weâ€™ll generate some sample data in near real-time using the Kinesis Data Generator tool and stream it to Amazon S3 via Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.

Additionally, we will directly upload some reference data into an Amazon S3 bucket.

To begin, login to AWS Console in **us-east-1** region: [Click me](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1)
